# Diabetes Risk Analysis
Diabetes Risk Analysis

I analyzed a dataset collected using direct questionnaires from patients with diabetes and approved by a doctor.  The data set holds data from 520 patients. I applied Model Using K-Fold Cross-Validation. 

The objective of the analysis is to evaluate the factors that will increment the risk of developing a diabetes diagnosis.  I assessed the impacts and importance of other factors as Polyuria, sudden weight loss, visual blurring, partial paresis, and the negative impact of this factor on incrementing the risk of being diagnosed with diabetes.

The dataset selected contains 17 features, which report clinical, body, and lifestyle information. The majority of the features are binary as anemia, gender polydipsia, weakness, itching, obesity, and delayed healing.

I implemented a model using the K-Fold Cross Validation method, presenting a 95 percent accuracy performance. Machine learning can be used to predict patientsâ€™ diagnoses from their data and individuate the most important features among those included within their medical records.
